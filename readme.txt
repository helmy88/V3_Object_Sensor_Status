Project Name: Multiple Maker Object Sensor (Opponent) Tester

Description:
This project involves an Arduino code that interfaces with multiple Maker Object Sensors (opponent sensors) to test their conditions. It reads the state of each sensor to determine if an opponent is detected and provides real-time feedback through the Serial Monitor.

1. Requirements:
- Multiple Maker Object Sensors (opponent sensors)
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- USB cable for connecting the Arduino to your computer

2. Installation:
- Connect each Maker Object Sensor's signal pin to appropriate digital pins on the Arduino (sensorPins array in the code).
- Connect the Arduino to your computer using the USB cable.

3. Usage:
- Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino board.
- Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the sensor statuses.
- The Serial Monitor will display whether an opponent is detected or not for each sensor.

4. Sensor Behavior:
- The code reads the state of each opponent sensor in sequence.
- If the sensor's state is HIGH, it indicates that an opponent is detected, and "Opponent Detected!" will be displayed.
- If the state is LOW, "No Opponent Detected" will be displayed.

5. Troubleshooting:
- Double-check the wiring connections between the Maker Object Sensors and the Arduino.
- Ensure that the correct pins are specified in the code for reading each sensor's signal.
