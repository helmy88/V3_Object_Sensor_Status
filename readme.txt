Project Name: Maker Object Sensor (Opponent) Tester

Description:
This project involves an Arduino code that interfaces with the Maker Object Sensor (opponent sensor) to test its condition. It reads the sensor's state to determine if an opponent is detected and provides real-time feedback through the Serial Monitor.

1. Requirements:
- Maker Object Sensor (opponent sensor)
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- USB cable for connecting the Arduino to your computer

2. Installation:
- Connect the Maker Object Sensor's signal pin to an appropriate digital pin on the Arduino (opponentSensorPin in the code).
- Connect the Arduino to your computer using the USB cable.

3. Usage:
- Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino board.
- Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the sensor's status updates.
- The Serial Monitor will display whether an opponent is detected or not.

4. Sensor Behavior:
- The code reads the state of the opponent sensor in a loop.
- If the sensor's state is HIGH, it indicates that an opponent is detected, and "Opponent Detected!" will be displayed.
- If the state is LOW, "No Opponent Detected" will be displayed.

5. Troubleshooting:
- Double-check the wiring connections between the Maker Object Sensor and the Arduino.
- Ensure that the correct pin is specified in the code for reading the sensor's signal.
